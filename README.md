**README - Clothing E-Store Website**

Welcome to the README file for the Clothing E-Store Website project. This document serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and completing the requirements for the creation of a fictitious clothing e-store. Utilizing the HTML techniques discussed in class and chapters 3 and 5 of the textbook, we aim to develop a visually appealing and functional online platform. Below, you'll find detailed instructions on how to structure your work and insert your content for each section of the project.

### Home Page
- **Objective**: Craft an engaging home page (index.html) within the "ass1" sub-folder. This page should serve as the entry point to the clothing store, effectively conveying its identity, unique selling points, and enticing customers to explore further.
